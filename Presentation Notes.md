### INFOST120 – Russia VS GitHub Presentation

Poster Presentation Outline / Presentation Notes

Goldsborough, Nate

#### **Topic:** Russian invasion of Ukraine and its effect on the Open-Source community worldwide.

This is complicated because the story is developing, and more news comes out daily, so this poster is already outdated in the last three weeks of designing it.

Since the formal start of the invasion on February 24th of, 2022, hundreds of companies have voluntarily pulled out of Russia, and thousands more have been forbidden from doing business with any Russian entities, especially the Russian government. This is due to massive economic sanctions.

The parent company of GitHub, Microsoft, has even done this. But GitHub put out a statement on March 2nd, 2022, just six days after the start of the invasion reaffirming its commitment to the open-source community and developers everywhere.

It is a valid point to say, “we'll just cut them off completely,” “Why is FOSS even that important anyway?” “Who cares? Cut off their software.” But these statements are missing some precious information. Firstly according to Fredrickson and GitHub, 4.3% of the FOSS developers were Russian. That is 1.9 million people and a lot of code.

The argument is that removing access to these developers’ code will negatively impact the entire world, either because projects are abandoned, which can lead to vulnerably not being patched, or it can lead to sabotage of FOSS projects like the recent poisoning of node-IPC, which is a repository in millions of software’s around the world. This is a severe threat either as an act of protest or deliberate sabotage.

**Impacted people:** Everyone that uses FOSS, software dependent on FOSS…. So everyone.

**Trade-off 1:** GitHub is not (for the most part) cutting off Russian access to software, which is not “putting pressure on the Russian administration to change.”

**Tradeoff 2:** GitHub is keeping many open-source projects alive and maintaining a support line for thousands of more programs; however, acts of sabotage like we saw with node-IPC could happen.

**Muddle:** Since GitHub is a private company and also since they are subject to US export control laws, there is really no telling what they will do in the future. We have to take them at their word.

**Policy vacuum:** While subject to US export laws, it is really unclear what GitHub is required to do in light of economic sanctions and what they do of their own volition.

**The Duty:** To protect global access to FOSS.

#### - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **Analysis** - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**Utilitarianism:** Says that GitHub must keep FOSS available to all developers even those under sanction including the Russian government because the thread to the FOSS community is worse than not punishing the Russian government.

**Deontology:** Duty is to protect global access to FOSS. The action cannot be universalized because of the direct harm that it would cause to innocent people. It even uses people as a means to an end because the alternative threatens individuals with their jobs, sometimes life’s work to use as leverage against the Russian govt. Therefore it violated both and is not ethical under deontology.

**Rawlsian Justice:** Are all rights distributed equally? Yes, because keeping GitHub available to all developers in sanctioned countries theoretically affords them the same freedoms to develop software as the rest of us. Everyone can use GitHub and is therefore given a fair shot. Those least well-off would still be the Sanctioned entities but because GitHub cannot do anything about that, they give what they can to the average person. Therefore it is ethical because it is doing what they can give the restrictions by the US and other governments.

**Ethics of Care:** Who needs care? All of the developers in the world depend on GitHub as a platform for collaboration and to get their work done and make money. I think most developers in the FOSS community want GitHub and similar companies to have our backs.

**Final thought: It** is ethical for GitHub to continue operations in Russia despite the indirect harm it is causing to many people
