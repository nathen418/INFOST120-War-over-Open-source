This publication talks about how geography changes the development of open-source software and provides some key data on the contributions that Russian developers make to the OSS (Specifically GitHub) community. It first talks about how policymakers often promote OSS as a cost-saving measure for governments to invest in, however, do not see or forget to point out that software development often is centralized geographically. Software development seems to cluster close together. Either way, it talks about how the geography of a locale directly influences its ability to contribute. The second issue it brings up is the advantages that OSS devs in these development hubs like San Francisco, etc have over those working either by themselves or in smaller population centers It is valuable for my project because it provides me some numbers that will be useful in explaining the virtual and physical harm to the world that would be caused by cutting off all Russian developers. For instance, Russia contributed 4.3% of all the commits to Github in 2021 and is number 36 in the world in terms of OSS devs per capita. My virtual harm case was stated above in explaining why it (my article) is important. A conceptual muddle here is how accurate the data they are pulling from. It is possible to set your GitHub and Twitter location to anywhere in the world with no verification, and so I question somewhat these numbers but trust them because the paper is peer-reviewed.

*Our response to the war in Ukraine. (2022, March 2). The GitHub Blog. <https://github.blog/2022-03-02-our-response-to-the-war-in-ukraine/>*

This article was written by Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of GitHub, and details GitHub's response to the war in Ukraine and why the company does not think pulling out of Russia is in the world's best interest. The ethical issue here is whether GitHub, by keeping operations in Russia going, is directly or indirectly causing death, destruction, and sorrow to those affected by Russian aggression in Ukraine. The argument is that Russia needs to be cut off from the rest of the world and starve to force a regime change to end the conflict. Whether that will work is a different story. The point is that If GitHub, one of the largest repository locations for code across the globe, cuts off Russia, it will severely starve them of technological innovation. This, in turn, is supposed to cause policy shifts in the Russian government. This article is the cornerstone and inspiration for my project. It illustrates how access to free and open-source software (FOSS) can be weaponized. Many organizations like GitHub, the Open-Source Initiative (OSI), and the Free Software Foundation (FSF), Explicitly state that the goal of FOSS is to be 100% free for ANYONE to use. This is a core tenant of the FOSS model. By arguing that the damage to the rest of the world, including the immediate and immense threat to billions of pieces of software to sabotage and abandonment, is too important to risk, they (GitHub) are reiterating their commitment to a free and open-source future. Addressing virtual harm here: One can argue that GitHub and other groups directly contribute to military advancement and the increasing human suffering by not blocking Russian users. Furthermore, while this is true, it also ignores or is ignorant of how much of everyone's lives are dependent on the EXPLICIT freedom of FOSS. Between 70% of web servers, for example, are open source. GitHub has stated (implicitly) that the harm to the very foundation of open source is too great in a post [here](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/12042#discussioncomment-2276190). One conceptual muddle here, though, is how the [United States Export Restrictions (OFAC/ITAR/EASS)](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls) will affect the­­­ company's position. **UPDATE (4/16/2022): GitHub now seems to be suspending or deleting accounts associated with Russian sanctioned entities. Some Russian users with no ties to sanctioned entities or the government are also reporting their accounts suddenly gone with a message that they were deleted to "Comply with US trade and export laws". This story is actively developing.**

*The Open-Source Definition (Annotated) | Open-Source Initiative*. (n.d.). Opensource.org. <https://opensource.org/osd-annotated>

This source is very important because, along with the FSF, the OSI is one of the de-facto authoritative bodies on what FOSS means. They write the standards that millions of developers abide by every day. The backbone of the world is FOSS, and this organization helps define that. The document I have cited above is the OSI definition of open source and its meaning to the world. There the foundation lays out ten tenants to what FOSS means. Directly contributing value to my project is tenant 5 and 6; "The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons." And "The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor." These tenants are what GitHub and other organizations that support FOSS development are standing on. There aren't any ethical issues that I can think of, but one argument I can make for the idea that FOSS should be restricted by nationality or other such labels is that, for instance, the Government of Russia is committing genocide against the Ukrainian people and if FOSS is restricted in the country it could force regime change. This will have dire side effects and cause future precedent for restriction. We do not know what plans may be to create restrictions on FOSS in countries like Russia. It has already happened in countries like Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, to great consequence. I think that there is a policy vacuum where regulation to support international trade in FOSS without such restrictions needs to be created.

This Source is an analysis of what the concept of open source is and why it is important, then talks about examples of what it calls “collective invention” which in essence describes many OSS projects because they are developed by many people at once. It also talks about how the open-source movement as we know it started and some early examples as well as analyzes what is special about open source software that proprietary software lacks. The first ethical issue that publication raises is the immense issue of companies taking open source projects, modifying them, and then releasing them as proprietary software. Essentially violating copyright law and committing IP theft. It is a massive problem in the OSS world. The second issue that it raises is whether OSS is better for the collective progress of software development or not. A question that tries to invalidate the work that powers so much of our daily lives. This publication is valuable to my project because it intimately discusses most aspects of my topic; Explaining the importance of open source, its tenants, examples, pros/cons, etc. My other articles then complement it with more details on its individual facets. One policy vacuum that is mentioned is on the legality of open source licenses. They have never really had a true legal test in court “comes to the conclusion that OS licenses are not effective because of their legal qualities (in fact, as yet their legal validity has never been tested in court12), but because the community is willing to accept and put through the norms they conceive as good behavior.” The second policy vacuum is over what legal recourse OSS developers have when corporations with big legal teams steal their IP.
